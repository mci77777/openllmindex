# CraftHub Marketplace — About

## Who We Are

CraftHub is an online marketplace dedicated to handmade goods, vintage finds, and craft supplies. We connect independent makers and curators with buyers who value creativity, craftsmanship, and authenticity.

## Our Mission

To support independent creators by giving them a global platform to sell their work, while providing buyers with a curated destination for unique, thoughtfully made products.
