# MODA Fashion — FAQ

## Sizing & Fit

**Do MODA styles run true to size (TTS)?**
Most MODA core essentials run true to size. If a style runs small/oversized, we note it on the product page under Fit Notes.

**Where can I find the size chart?**
Each product page includes a size chart and garment measurements. Global guide: https://modafashion.com/size-guide

**What is your size range?**
Many styles are graded from **XXS–4XL**. Some limited drops may have a narrower range depending on fabric and construction.

**I’m between sizes — what should I choose?**
For a closer fit, size down; for a relaxed fit, size up. If the fabric is compressive (e.g., leggings), consider sizing up for comfort.

**Can I get fit advice before ordering?**
Yes. Email support@modafashion.com with the items you’re considering, your height, and key measurements.

## Products & Care

Materials vary by product. Common fabrics include cotton jersey, modal blends, performance knits, and responsibly sourced/recycled fibers where performance allows.

**How should I care for my items?**
Follow the care label. As a general rule: wash cold, gentle cycle, avoid high heat, and lay flat or hang dry to extend garment life.

Some core essentials restock. Limited drops may not. If an item is restocking, we’ll note it on the product page and email subscribers when available.
