# The Golden Fork Restaurant — About

## Our Story

The Golden Fork opened its doors in 2012 with a simple belief: exceptional food should be matched by exceptional hospitality. Founded by Chef Marco Bellini, a Michelin-trained chef from Milan, The Golden Fork brings refined European cuisine to the heart of New York City's West Village.

## Cuisine & Philosophy

We serve contemporary European cuisine with a focus on seasonal, locally sourced ingredients. Our menu changes with the seasons and is inspired by Chef Bellini's travels through France, Italy, and Spain.
